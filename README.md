# Causal Discovery from Observable Data (CMU, 10-708 course project)
*Sukriti Verma, Priyam Tejaswin*

## Required packages:
```
1. numpy
2. cdt
3. deap
4. rpy2
5. notears (Github release only) https://github.com/xunzheng/notears/releases/tag/v2.3
6. ges
```

**Notes**:
1. Some algorithms for `cdt` will require R-libraries as well as PyTorch for continuous optimization.
2. Iterative search algorithms like `GES` and `GA` will take about 12 hours to complete.
3. `NOTEARS` and `SAM` will require GPU hardware. They have not been tested on CPU hardware.

## Motivation analysis
Run cells in .ipynb in order. Data is provided in csv files. Model outpus are also provided for reference.

## Proposed (GA) model, evaluation and results
Run the cells in .ipynb in order. Data has been provided in csv files.
